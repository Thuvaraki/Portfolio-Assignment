            <h4>Student at University Of Kelaniya.</h4>
            <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! I'm an enthusiastic University of Kelnaiya software engineering student 
                who is passionate about transforming concepts into useful and cutting-edge software solutions.</br> I have a 
                solid background in programming languages, algorithms, and software development methodologies,
                and I'm dedicated to extending the capabilities of technology.</br> The challenges I've faced throughout my
                career in software engineering have only strengthened my resolve to keep learning, developing, and creating. </br>
                I enjoy the chance to use technology to create a positive impact, whether that be through creating web applications,
                mobile apps, or resolving challenging coding issues.</br> I invite you to learn more about my work and experiences,
                and I'm eager to get in touch with other software enthusiasts, collaborators, and potential employers who share
